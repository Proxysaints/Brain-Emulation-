- VDSA should use HandleData functions.
- Remove duplicate functions, use templates where that helps.
- Flatten the calcium structs.
- Fewer namespaces, avoid nested namespaces.
- Properly isolate unrelated code.
- All structs should have identifiable default values to simplify knowing if they were not given actual values.
